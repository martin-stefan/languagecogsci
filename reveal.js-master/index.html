						<p>This video showed a few good examples of how different languages allow people to think differently about certain events</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>However, does this mean that they people perceive the world differently based on what language they speak?</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						This brings up the Sapir Whorf hypothesis
					</section>

					<section>
						This hypothesis states that language determines thought. Using an example from the video, the Sapir Whorf
						hypothesis would claim that Russians are capable of recognizing different colors of blue because of the language they speak. 
					</section>

					<section>
						If this claim were true, this could provide many different implications of the abilities of humans and it could mean that 
						speaking another language "unlocks" some sort of ability.
						<br>
						<br>
						This sounds too good to be true. 
					</section>

					<section>
						It is.
					</section>

					<section>
						The Sapir Whorf hypothesis struggled to provide much evidence that would strengthen their claim and other researchers found evidence 
						which contradicts it.  
					</section>

				</section>

				<section>
					It seems then that language does not actually change how we see the world, however it allows us to describe the world differently.
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						But what about a person who does not think with language?

						It is quite common to be able to think using a voice within the head, but do people who not have that ability
						think differently than those who do?
					</section>

					<section>
						Here are firsthand examples of someone who does not have an inner voice
					</section>

					<section>
						Although this is only one person's perspective on how they think without having an inner voice, 
						it still raises some questions such as:
					</section>

					<section>
						Do people without an inner voice have a worse memory?
					</section>

					<section>
						Do people without an inner voice not have the ability of abstract thought?
					</section>

				</section>

				<section>
					As of right now, inner voice is a topic that is not completely understood. 
				</section>

				<section>
					However
